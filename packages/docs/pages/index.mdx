# Introduction

## Warning

The API is extremely open for changes right now as we're deciding the best implementation for Kaito.
We wouldn't recommend using this for a future project unless you enjoy broken code. Some people do.

### Features

- ‚úç built in schema + body validation support
- ‚ö° ultra quick. Speeds are on par with [polka](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polka)
- üí™ robust
- üí® extremely easy to use, built with decorators

## What is Kaito

Kaito is a minimalistic, HTTP framework for Node.js and TypeScript. It can also work in JavaScript environments, but
this may change in the future.
