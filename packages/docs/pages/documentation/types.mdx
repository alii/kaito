# Types

## `KaitoContext`

This is the request object, not too dissimilar from express' `Request`.

Right now, there are not a lot of utility properties. You can access the underlying data with `req#raw`.
This is the raw `IncomingMessage` object.

You can also import the alias `CTX` (which is the exact same type, inc. generics).

## `KaitoReturnType`

<Callout>You can import this type as `KRT` for brevity</Callout>

This type is the easiest way to type a response from a method. You can use it like this

```ts
@Get("/")
async myMethod(): KRT<{name: string}> {
  return { name: "Adam" };
}
```

Or, if you would like to specify response types, you can do the following.

```ts
@Get("/")
async myMethod(): KRT<{name: string}> {
  return {
    json: { name: "Adam" },
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'X-Universe': '42'
    }
  };
}
```

Headers and status here are entirely optional.

## `RequestHandler`

You shouldn't need to use this type too often, unless you are writing an interface that a class can implement.
We plan to ship some built in interfaces in the future that will allow to strongly type controllers, but for now,
`RequestHandler` is simply the method (or function) definition for a function that takes `req` and returns a
`Promise` fufilled by `KRT`. This type is not aliased.
