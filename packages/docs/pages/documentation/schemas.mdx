# Schemas

Kaito has rich integration with [Yup](https://npmjs.org/package/yup), the schema validation library.
It's easy to use with Kaito.

## Basic Usage

```ts
import * as yup from 'yup';

@Schema(yup.object({ name: yup.string() }))
@Post("/body-test")
async echoValidName(ktx: KTX<{ name: string }>) {
  return ktx.body
}
```

In this method, Kaito is parsing the incoming body from the request and validating it with Yup. If the schema is
invalid, an error is thrown, and the request finishes before your class method is even called. A list of errors is
then sent back to the sender.

<Callout>You cannot use the @Schema decorator on a GET request!</Callout>
