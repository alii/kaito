# Decorators

## Available Decorators

##### Methods

- `@Get` - for GET requests. You cannot use an `@Schema` with this method
- `@Post` – POST requests
- `@Patch` – PATCH requests (usually mutations)
- `@Put` – POST requests (usually insertions)
- `@Delete` – POST requests (usually deletions)

#### Utilities

- `@Schema` - lets you check a request body to match a certain schema. Read more about Schemas at [/documentation/schemas](/documentation/schemas)
- `@Controller` - tells `Reflect` that this class is a controller, and mounts your methods onto the express instance
