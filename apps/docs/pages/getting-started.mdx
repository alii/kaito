# Getting started

## Installation

Kaito depends on `zod` for schema validation, make sure you install it too.

```
yarn add @kaito-http/core zod
```

Or with npm:

```
npm install @kaito-http/core zod
```

## Concepts

Kaito is very simple to use, it revolves around a few basic concepts. Before we dive into a code example, let's go through the three most important principles.

### Routes

A route is a function that is available on the API. Simply put, it's something that will exist over HTTP and returns a single value that will be JSON encoded. Below is a basic example

```ts
export const getUsers = router().add('GET', '/users', {
	async run() {
		return database.getUsers();
	},
});
```

### Router

The Kaito router is a class that holds all of our routes, their type information. Every app will have one router.

### Context

Context is a variable that is generated on every single request. It is up to developers what to place inside their context, but it will be available to access in every single route. For example, you could include the `req` and `res` objects, a method to get the current user (replacing middleware), etc.

## Quickstart

Firstly, we need to setup our context. You can put this in a `context.ts` file, for example.

```typescript
import {createGetContext, InferContext, Router} from '@kaito-http/core';

// Define the time that we started the server at
const serverStarted = Date.now();

// Provide context to every route â€” our uptime and `req` & `res` objects
export const getContext = createGetContext(async (req, res) => ({
	req,
	res,
	uptime: Date.now() - serverStarted,
}));

// Export a type of our context
export type AppContext = InferContext<typeof getContext>;

// Define a context-typed router
export function router() {
	return Router.create<AppContext>();
}
```

Secondly, we'll need to create a router, a server, and our first route.

```typescript
import {createServer} from '@kaito-http/core';
import {router, getContext} from './context';

const app = router().add('GET', '/', async ({ctx}) => {
	return {
		uptime: ctx.uptime,
		time_now: Date.now(),
	};
});

const server = createServer({
	getContext,
	router: app,

	// Define an async `onError` handler, in case something goes wrong inside of the route.
	// More on that that later.
	onError: async ({error}) => {
		console.log(error);

		return {
			status: 500,
			message: error.message,
		};
	},
});

server.listen(8080);
```

Awesome! So we now have a server that can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/` that mounts a GET route to `/` which will respond with the server's uptime, and the time now. If you run this file and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`, you'll see that result.
