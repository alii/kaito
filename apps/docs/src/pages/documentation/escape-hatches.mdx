# Escape Hatches

We firmly believe that you shouldn't need to escape out of Kaito's control. It covers the 9.98/10 use cases of an API-oriented HTTP framework.

But, perhaps, say you need to setup a Webhook server for Stripe... Or want to add an OAuth callback handler. This previously has not been possible in Kaito.

## Raw Routes

Kaito supports what we called "Raw Routes" which is direct access to the raw http request and response objects.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
	Raw routes are not type safe, do not catch errors like regular routes nor provide regular Kaito req and res objects.
</Callout>

Raw routes are defined when you initialise your server. Below is an example of how to use raw routes.

```ts {4}
const server = createServer({
	// ...

	rawRoutes: {
		GET: [
			{
				path: '/',
				handler: (req, res) => {
					res.end('Hello World');
				},
			},

			{
				path: '/test',
				handler: (req, res) => {
					res.end('Test');
				},
			},
		],
	},
});
```

Now, if you visit `/` or `/test` you will see the response from the raw route. Kaito has not handled them at all
