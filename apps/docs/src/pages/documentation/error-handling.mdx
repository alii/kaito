# Error Handling

Errors are handled very gracefully in Kaito. You can throw an error in any route, and it will always be caught and handled. This means that you don't have to worry about catching errors in your routes, and you can focus on writing your application.

## Throwing Errors

Kaito has a built in error called `KaitoError`. You can throw this error in your routes, and it will be caught and sent back to the client.

<Callout>
	Throwing a `KaitoError` will **not** call your `.onError` handler defined in your server. KaitoErrors are handled
	internally and are always sent back to the client.
</Callout>

```ts {8}
export const users = router().get('/:id', async ({ctx, params}) => {
	const user = await ctx.db.users.findOne({
		where: {id: params.id},
	});

	if (!user) {
		// Client will receive this status code and error message. Will *not* be passed to the .onError() handler
		throw new KaitoError(404, 'User not found');
	}

	return user;
});
```

All other errors will be forwarded to your `.onError` handler, which dictates what status and message should be sent to the client.
