# Getting started

<Callout type="warning">
	Please read all documentation. These docs are not complete and although almost all of the features of Kaito are
	described least somewhere on this website, it might not be where you would expect it to be. I don't have infinite time
	to work on Kaito and its docs, so if you would like to help you can sponsor me on GitHub, or submit documentation PRs
	yourself. Thank you!

## Installation

Kaito depends on `zod` for schema validation, make sure you install it too.

```bash
yarn add @kaito-http/core zod
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install @kaito-http/core zod
```

## Concepts

Kaito is very simple to use, it revolves around a few basic concepts. Before we dive into a code example, let's go through the three most important principles.

### Routes

A route is a function that is available on the API. Simply put, it's something that will exist over HTTP and returns a single value that will be JSON encoded. Below is a basic example

```ts
export const app = router().get('/users', async ({ctx}) => {
	return ctx.db.getUsers();
});
```

### Router

The Kaito router is a class that holds all of our routes and their type information. Every app will have at least one router and they can be merged together so you can separate your routes into different files.

### Context

Context is a variable that is generated on every single request. It is up to developers what to place inside their context, but it will be available to access in every single route. For example, you could include the `req` and `res` objects, a method to get the current session, etc.

## Quickstart

Firstly, we need to setup our context. You can put this in a `context.ts` file, for example.

```typescript
import {createUtilities} from '@kaito-http/core';

// Define the time that we started the server at
const serverStarted = Date.now();

// Context is generated on every request, and is available in every route.
// We can choose to pass in the request and response objects, as well as
// any other utilities (perhaps a database connection, ORM, other utils, etc).
export const {router, getContext} = createUtilities(async (req, res) => ({
	req,
	res,
	uptime: Date.now() - serverStarted,
}));
```

Secondly, we'll need to create a router, a server, and our first route.

```typescript
import {createServer} from '@kaito-http/core';
import {router, getContext} from './context';

const app = router().get('/', async ({ctx}) => {
	return {
		uptime: ctx.uptime,
		time_now: Date.now(),
	};
});

const server = createServer({
	// Pass our getContext function to the root server options
	getContext,

	// And pass our root router
	router: app,

	// Define an async `onError` handler, in case something goes wrong inside of the route.
	// More on that that later.
	onError: async ({error}) => {
		console.log(error);

		return {
			status: 500,
			message: error.message,
		};
	},
});

server.listen(8080);
```

Awesome! So we now have a server that can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/` that mounts a GET route to `/` which will respond with the server's uptime, and the time now. If you run this file and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`, you'll see that result.
