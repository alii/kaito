# Kaito

Kaito is a seriously good HTTP Server Framework for TypeScript. It works with many runtimes, including Bun, Node, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, & more. It's based on the modern Web Fetch API using Request/Response objects.

### Features

- ✍ Works with any validation library, although we recommend [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- 🧑‍💻 Insane TypeScript support, with full e2e type safety to your client
- ⚡ Stupidly fast, built for performance and is often many times faster than other frameworks
- 💨 Very intuitive API, only need to learn a few concepts and the rest falls into place
- 📦 Absolutely tiny package size, making it ideal for serverless environments
- 🏎️ Streaming support with built-in utilities for doing server-sent events (SSE)

### Why Kaito?

The most popular HTTP Server frameworks on npm are all built for Node.js, and are all similar iterations of a very dated pattern that was popularized by Express.js.

Kaito is different. We've reimagined what a modern HTTP Server Framework should be, and we've built it from the ground up to be the best possible experience for TypeScript developers.
